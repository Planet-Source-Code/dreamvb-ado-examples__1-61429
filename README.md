## ADO Examples


</div>

### Description

This is a small collection of ADO Examples I made some time back. it was ment to be as a small tutor. but I never finsihed it. so I thought I may as well let you people have them. mostly for a Beginner, starts of by makeing a simple connection, to viewing, adding and editing data, and also some tools, such as Compact and Createing a new database and adding a new table. All examples are also commented, and are in seperate folder. Hope this may help some beginners out.
